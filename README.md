# DLND-your-first-network

UDACIY Deep Learning Foundation Course

Project 1

In this project, we will be building a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset!

By building a neural network from the ground up, we'll have a much better understanding of gradient descent, backpropagation,

and other concepts that are important to know before we move to higher level tools such as Tensorflow.

we will also get to see how to apply these networks to solve real prediction problems!

The data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Database.

#Instructions

Download the project materials from this link,

https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/January/588d28a7_dlnd-your-first-network/dlnd-your-first-network.zip

unzip it...

cd into the dlnd-your-first-network folder that you just unzipped.

Download anaconda or miniconda based on the instructions in the Anaconda lesson.

Create a new conda environment:

conda create --name dlnd python=3

Enter your new environment:

Mac/Linux: >> source activate dlnd

Windows: >> activate dlnd

Ensure you have numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and jupyter notebook installed by doing the following:

conda install numpy matplotlib pandas jupyter notebook

Run the following to open up the notebook:

jupyter notebook dlnd-your-first-neural-network.ipynb
